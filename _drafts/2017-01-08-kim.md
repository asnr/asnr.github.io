* What struck me the most about the writing in Kim is that it reads like a slightly older high fantasy novel. (Not to say that Kim was influenced by that genre or vice versa, remembering that Kim was published in 1901.) The protagonist is a young boy with extraordinary abilities; the setting is alien to its intended Western audience of the early 1900's, and Kipling revels in describing its exotic details:

On the whole, very prudish.
