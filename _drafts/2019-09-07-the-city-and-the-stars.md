_There will be spoilers._

The City and the Stars is a story where a millenium is a blink of an eye, where nothing important takes less than a million years. The story spends most of its time in Diaspar, a city and culture that has continued largely unchanged for over a billion years. This scale is awesome, and Clarke is at his most eloquent describing it:

> Before Diaspar there was simply—the Dawn Ages. In that Limbo were merged inextricably together the first men to tame fire and the first to release atomic energy—the first men to build a log canoe and the first to reach the stars. On the far side of this desert of time, they were all neighbours. [pg. 31]

For me, this is the most memorable aspect of The City and the Stars. Where many science fiction authors will content themselves with extrapolating society a hundred years into the future, Clarke pushes his world much further. He imagines the kind of society, technology and human body that would survive so incredibly far into the future, and the result is compelling.

The narrative of The City and the Stars starts slowly. We follow the protagonist Alvin as he moves through Diaspar, introducing us to the city and its culture. This takes us through the first third of the book, in which Alvin is largely by himself. An exploration of the second civilisation surviving on Earth, Lys, takes up a little bit less space. Then pace really gets cracking and we get taken to worlds across the galaxy, encounter planet-scale monsters and beings made of pure thought. By the end, Clarke is squeezing the history of human space-faring into a few compact pages.

This is perhaps the greatest weakness of The City and the Stars: it tries to cram in too many stories, too much history and there is no space left for the detail necessary to bring it to life.

There are also smaller disappointments in the prose. As far in the future as he was able to sling our society, Clarke was not able to shed misogyny which even now seems dated:

> the floor slowed imperceptibly until it came to rest at the end of a long hall lined with mirrors and Alvin knew there was no hope of hurrying Alystra here. It was not merely that some feminine characteristics had survived unchanged since Eve... [pg. 34]

and

> Though birth had been forgotten, the feminine instincts of protection and sympathy still remained. [pg. 64]

Paragraphs could occasionally be tighter. Redundant clauses sneak in, in the style of over-eager fantasy novels. Describing a train coming to a stop at a subway station, Clarke writes

> More and more slowly moved the machine; this was no mere slackening of speed. It was coming at last to rest. [pg. 88]
