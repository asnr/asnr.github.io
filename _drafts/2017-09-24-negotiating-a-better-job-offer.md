In the not-too-distant past I got a job offer.

Patrick McKenzie's [essay](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation) on salary negotiation. Talks about:
- never give a number first
- responses to give when you are asked to give a number first

This is super important! One thing I didn't appreciate at first is how hard it is to follow these suggestions with someone from HR sitting right in front of you. The first time I was asked how much I wanted, I was caught completely off guard and, *knowing full well that the last thing I should do is give them my number*, I gave them my number.

I didn't want to be difficult! I wanted to be helpful! It's my natural instinct, because day-to-day I'm working with my team, and getting our job done is a non-zero-sum game.

Patrick McKenzie suggests conducting the salary negotiation by email, because it will give you more time to prepare your response. This is an excellent suggestion! If you can do this, do this. In my experience though, things don't always pan out this way. The person you're negotiating with won't warn you that they're about to bring up the topic of salary negotiations and they won't give you five minutes to compose yourself and get your serious-business-person face on. Instead, they'll start by saying that the last interview went really well and that the feedback was great, and you'll say "That's great to hear! I also really liked Alex and Jaksha", and while you're riding that little high of success, they'll slide in, "So what are you currently on?", or "What are your salary expectations for this role?", and, being distracted, you will tell them your number.

Don't get distracted; don't tell them your number.

This is easier said than done though, so I recommend practising. Get your friend/partner/image in the mirror to ask you variations of "So, what is your current salary?". Do this until your response is automatic.

## Give yourself time to get a counter-offer

Without being asked, I *volunteered* to respond the morning of the next business day. I should have given myself more time to get a counter offer.

I said that's an wonderful number, should have said that is an interesting number.
