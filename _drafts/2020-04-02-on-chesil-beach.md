- At start, explains characters' actions by comparing them to norms that would come in the future. Pg 22, "It was in theory open to them to abandon their plates, ... and run down to the shore and kick their shoes off and exult in their liberty... In just a few years' time, that would be the kind of thing quite ordinary young people would do." Pg 26, "The language and practice of therapy, the currency of feelings diligently shared, mutually shared, were not yet in general circulation." What is the effect here? Gives readers a sense of superiority? Patronises the characters? Makes them more vulnerable, removes their agency, drawing readers' sympathy?

- "Theoritically free", pg 29. This is common theme in first pages, freedom which isn't. Ian is brutal: "They were alone then, and theoretically free to do whatever they wanted, but they went on eating the dinner they had no appetite for." (Some foreshadowing here?) Later, pg 41, Ian is explicit: "She was trapped in a game whose rules she could not question."

- Sometimes clumsy? "Anyone over fourty would have fought or suffered in the war and known death on an unusual scale". Death on an unusual scale for WWII?

- Ian is brutal describing the couple having sex.

- In the beginning of their relationship, already the parallel worlds: "her finger trailed, surely not by accident, across the inside of his wrist", pg 59.
